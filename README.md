CashCalc frontend using React Hooks and Material-UI.

This project aims to give additional support for people working in logistics to calculate transportation costs.

It is a collaboration between me and [@istvann](https://github.com/IstvanN).
The backend can be found [here](https://github.com/IstvanN/cashcalc-backend).
